description: |
    Truth catalog for proto-dc2 run 1.2 (corresponding to proto-dc2_v3.0).
    This is a truth catalog for static sources only.  There are no supernovae.
    Reported AGN magnitudes are the baseline magnitudes on top of which the
    variability model is layered.  This truth information was generated with
    version 2.1.2 of the proto-DC2 extragalactic catalog.
